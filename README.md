## How It Works

3. JavaScript selects the word and quote corresponding to the day and updates the content dynamically.
4. CSS ensures a visually appealing design with responsive layouts and glowing effects.

## How to Use

2. Open `word.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Ensure `styles.css` and `script.js` are properly linked.
4. The content will automatically update every day based on the system date.

## Future Improvements
